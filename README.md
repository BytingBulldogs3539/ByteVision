# ByteVision
ByteVision is a regularly updated repository of our vision tracking software. ByteVision runs on a single raspberrypi with two microsoft hd3000 webcameras pluged into two of its USB ports. The raspberrypi is currently powered off the roborio's usb port through a micro USB cable. ByteVision currently communicates with the roborio though the network using a ethernet switch that connects to both the roborio and the raspberrypi then connects to the radio. As of the moment ByteVision does not stream the video back to the driver station how ever we are currently working on that feature. This program also includes many fall back methods, such as giving the network 90 seconds to start and if it does not the raspberrypi assumes that it has had an issues obtaining an ip from the switch and will reboot (which we have had issues with in the past), It also includes protection if the USB camera does not properly connect that it will reboot(which we have also had issues with).The program also includes features of active switching between camera streams to limit the amount of processing the raspberry pi does. The program also finds the distance to the target as well as the angle the camera is at compaired to the object. This code is constantly in work FYI.
